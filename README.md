# OWASP SAMM
OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) is an open framework designed to assist organizations in analyzing and enhancing their software security posture. It provides a measurable and effective approach for organizations to implement software security strategies that are tailored to their specific needs35.


## OWASP SAMM categories
the "categories" are actually the five Business Functions that you listed:

* Governance: Focuses on strategy, metrics, and compliance.

* Design: Emphasizes security considerations during the architecture and design phases.

* Implementation: Deals with secure coding practices and build processes.

* Verification: Covers testing and validation activities to ensure security requirements are met.

* Operations: Concerns deployment, maintenance, and incident response.

Each of these Business Functions then contains several Security Practices, which are further broken down into Activities.
